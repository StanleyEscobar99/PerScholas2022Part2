JavaScript Callbacks and Arrow Functions

Question 1

When the add and subtract functions are passed as arguments to the compute function - they are ___ functions.

    Callbacks


Question 2

In your own words describe what the term "implicit return" means.

    From what we learned and from doing my own research it looks to ve that 
    that "implicit return" are when a function returns values without using
    the key word "return" & also the line of code has to be compact, just short 
    and to the point.

 

Question 3

Describe what a callback function is in your own words.

    I would describe a call back function as a function that you are putting in 
    as an argument for a different function. Basically calling on a function inside a function
    in a way.
